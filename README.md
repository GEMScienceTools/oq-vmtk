  <h3 align="center">Vulnerability Toolkit</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This repository contains an open source library that provides modelling of multi-degree-of-freedom systems and assessment via nonlinear time-history analyses for regional vulnerability and risk calculations. The vulnerability toolkit is developed by the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation and its collaborators.

# üõ†Ô∏è Features

* Modelling of Multi-Degree-of-Freedom Oscillators in OpenSees: Model single- and multi-degree-of-freedom system using low-level information (e.g., number of storeys, first-mode transformation factor, SDoF- or storey-based force-deformation relationships);
* Linear and Nonlinear Analysis in OpenSees:
  * Modal Analysis: Estimate Periods of Vibration and Modal Shapes;
  * Gravity Analysis
  * Nonlinear Static Analysis: Perform Static and Cyclic Pushover Analyses to Characterise the Lateral Load-Resisting Response of the System;
  * Dynamic Analysis: Perform Nonlinear Time-History Analyses using Selected Ground-Motion Records;
* Fragility Analysis: Calculate Median Seismic Intensities and Total Associated Dispersion (i.e., Record-to-Record Variability and Modelling Uncertainty):
  * Regression Analysis following Cloud Analysis Method to Characterise EDP|IM Relationship and Calculate Exceedance Probabilities of Damage;
* Vulnerability Analysis: Calculate Vulnerability Functions to Estimate Decision-Variables (Economic- and Human-Based) Conditioned on Ground-Shaking Intensity using Consequence Models (Damage-to-Loss Ratios)
* Plotting: Plot Analysis Outputs
  * Model Overview: OpenSees Model (Nodes and Elements)  
  * Cloud Analysis Results and Fitted IM|EDP Relationship
  * Seismic Demand Profiles: Distribution of Peak Storey Drifts and Peak Floor Accelerations
  * Fragility Functions
  * Vulnerability Functions

# ü§î Frequently asked questions

### How to contribute?

You can follow the instructions indicated in the [contributing guidelines](./contribute_guidelines.md). (Work-In-Progress)

### Which version am I seeing? How to change the version?

By default, you will see the files in the repository in the `main` branch. Each version of the model that is released can be accessed is marked with a `tag`. By changing the tag version at the top of the repository, you can change see the files for a given version.

Note that the `main` branch could contain the work-in-progress of the next version of the model.
