# Storey Loss Function Generation Demo

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to generate and visualize storey loss functions (SLFs) from component inventory data. The workflow involves reading inventory files that define structural and nonstructural components, including their quantities, fragility parameters, and repair costs. Using the `slf_generator` module from oq-vmtk, the data are processed into SLFs, which are then visualized with the `plotter` module. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to efficiently create SLFs, extract performance metrics, and present results.
