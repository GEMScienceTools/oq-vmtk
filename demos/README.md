# Demos

This folder contains an ensemble of example python notebooks demonstrating various steps within the GEM global vulnerability workflow highlighting earthquake catastrophe modelling and visualization techniques. Below is an overview of the four available examples:

## Example 1: Ground-Motion Record Processing
This example provides a workflow for processing ground-motion records, such as spectral analysis and identification if intensity measure values for distinct intensity measure types (e.g., PGA, Arias Intensity, etc.).

## Example 2: End-to-End Vulnerability Assessment of an MDOF System using Cloud Analysis
This example performs nonlinear time-history analysis on a multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) structural system calibrated using SDOF global capacity and using cloud analysis to assess seismic performance. The example also demonstrates postprocessing of cloud analysis results, including fragility curve estimation and vulnerability assessment visualization.

## Example 3: Generating and Visualizing Storey Loss Functions
This example focuses on computing and visualizing storey loss functions, providing insights into seismic damage assessment and economic loss estimation.
