# Intensity Measure Processing Demo

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates an example application of monotonic static pushover and cyclic pushover analyses on a multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) stick model where global and local response quantities such as base shear, storey displacements and interstorey drifts are extracted.

This Jupyter Notebook provides an example application of the `IMCalculator` module for reading ground motion record files and extracting distinct intensity measure (IM) levels across various IM types. Ground motion IMs are essential parameters that characterize the ground shaking and helps the modeller in understanding better the demand imposed by ground motions on structural systems and eventually characterise a probabilistic demand-intensity model to building classes under investigation.
